<h2>KARLINA</h2>
	Here you will find information about my band!
	<p>Hello! We are KARLINA! Our band would love the opportunity to come and play at your establishment!
	Our indie/ blues band has played gigs around the city and would love to play for you!
	We are a four-piece band with a singer (Karlina), guitarist (Ryan), keyboardist (Karlina), bassist (Curtis), and drummer (Josh).
	We play originals and covers ranging in the genre of Indie Rock!
	We would love to hear from you and possibly set up a meet-up soon! Thank you so much! See Contact tab for band inquiries!</p>
<h2>OUR ORIGIN STORY</h2>
	In 2020, I began writing music! Around September 2020, I recorded two songs, “Lie To Me” and “Crazy World”, about an abusive relationship. Both songs are released on all music streaming platforms!
<h2>WHY KARLINA?</h2>  
	I named the band KARLINA for marketing purposes! It is important that bands have a searchable name. I noticed there were no other KARLINA’s on any music streaming platforms!
	<p>Once “Lie To Me” and “Crazy World” were released, I made the decision to start my own band! The first member to join was my brother, Curtis! Curtis is a talented bass player and song writer! Our group has evolved so much since he started in 2020! The next member to join was my drummer, Josh! Josh is a very talented drummer! I asked if he would like to be KARLINA’s official drummer, and he agreed! Our last member to join was our guitarist, Ryan! Ryan is a talented guitarist! When I heard Ryan play guitar for the first time, I knew he had to be KARLINA’s official guitarist!</p>
<p>KARLINA’s story is dark, but it has colors drawn throughout it. We built our band to create awareness about the dangers of domestic violence while also shedding light on having a happy life! Let’s party together!</p>
