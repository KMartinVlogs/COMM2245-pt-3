<h2>EDUCATION</h2>
	Hello everyone! I am majoring in Psychology with a minor in Communications. I am on track to graduate in the summer of 2024! I am a returning student. In 2017, I received my associate degree at CNM in the CYFD program, with a concentration in social work.

<p>For the entirety of my adult life, I have worked at different schools around Albuquerque. I started at a privately owned preschool in 2015. Two years later, in 2017, I began teaching music at a private school. Two years later, in 2019, I became an elementary Educational Assistant for Albuquerque Public Schools. Specifically in the intellectually disabled program. My experience in the intellectually disabled program has been life changing. My favorite part of my day is watching the children grow and learn. My students use TouchChat devices to communicate. It brings me joy watching my students discover their own voice!</p>
<p>For the longest time, I desired a music teaching degree. I even met with an academic advisor to discuss my music schedule. However, my experience at Albuquerque Public Schools has redirected my path. Now I desire to pursue a career working with adults with Down-Syndrome. Rio Grande Down Syndrome Network is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to empower individuals with Down syndrome and their families through advocacy, education, and support.</p>
<p>Both Psychology and Communications have been excellent tools in my work life. Because of my classes at UNM, I feel confident with my career choice working with adults with Down-Syndrome. I have used the knowledge from these fields to elevate my teaching skills.</p>
