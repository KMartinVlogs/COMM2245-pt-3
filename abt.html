	Hello everyone! My name is Karlina Martin! I am a 28-year-old student, born locally in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I am majoring in Psychology with a minor in Communications. I am on track to graduate in the summer of 2024!
<h2>WHERE DID I GO TO SCHOOL?</h2>  
	I grew up in a religious cult located in Rio Rancho, NM! The cult is called Gospel Light Baptist Church. Gospel Light’s denomination is Independent Fundamental Baptist. I attended Gospel Light Baptist Academy from preschool to 12th grade. The academy was located inside the church. The academy had strict rules. Children were not allowed to listen to music or discuss pop culture. Girls were not allowed to interact with boys. Girls were not allowed to wear pants, tank tops, short skirts, tight shirts, colored socks, ankle socks, or have colored hair, or colored nails. There were multiple days out of the month where we were forced to pray or clean the church. I was not allowed to access the outside world. I could not go to concerts, movie theaters, or certain stores like Hot Topic or Spencer’s. If I went to the New Mexico State Fair, for example, I had to avoid areas that had live bands. Gospel Light’s curriculum is called Accelerated Christian Education (A.C.E.). A.C.E. is not accredited. A.C.E.’s program only focuses on biblical fundamentalism rather than on academics. I finally became passionate about my education when I attended CNM in 2013! <p>My strict religious environment molded me into the person I am today. I am empathetic. I try to put others before myself. I am passionate about helping others. I enjoy making a difference in my community. I do suffer with boundaries. However, I am working to improve myself every day! I started a band talking about my experiences growing up in a cult!</p> <p>Check out the details about my band on the Portfolio tab!</p>
